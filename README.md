# File_Checker
This script was created to check which data files contain a pressure reading.

There are >6000 files in the folder and >1000 file names to be checked. The filenames are
specific and the need to check them is also specific so I can't imagine this code will
be that useful outside this context.

There's some techniques which I might want to look at again though so it's good to have around.

It was written quickly as it will not be needed again and it gives the results I need.

Thanks
